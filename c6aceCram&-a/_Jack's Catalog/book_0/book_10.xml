      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        <strong>A fascinating investigation into how people around
        the globe are cashing in on a warming world</strong>
      </p>
      <p>McKenzie Funk has spent the last six years reporting
      around the world on how we are preparing for a warmer planet.
      Funk shows us that the best way to understand the catastrophe
      of global warming is to see it through the eyes of those who
      see it most clearly—as a market opportunity.</p>
      <p>Global warming’s physical impacts can be separated
      into three broad categories: melt, drought, and deluge. Funk
      travels to two dozen countries to profile entrepreneurial
      people who see in each of these forces a potential
      windfall.</p>
      <p>The melt is a boon for newly arable, mineral-rich regions
      of the Arctic, such as Greenland—and for the surprising
      kings of the manmade snow trade, the Israelis. The process of
      desalination, vital to Israel’s survival, can produce a
      snowlike by-product that alpine countries use to prolong
      their ski season.</p>
      <p>Drought creates opportunities for private firefighters
      working for insurance companies in California as well as for
      fund managers backing south Sudanese warlords who control
      local farmland. As droughts raise food prices globally, there
      is no more precious asset.</p>
      <p>The deluge—the rising seas, surging rivers, and
      superstorms that will threaten island nations and coastal
      cities—has been our most distant concern, but after
      Hurricane Sandy and failure after failure to cut global
      carbon emissions, it is not so distant. For Dutch architects
      designing floating cities and American scientists patenting
      hurricane defenses, the race is on. For low-lying countries
      like Bangladesh, the coming deluge presents an existential
      threat.</p>
      <p>Funk visits the front lines of the melt, the drought, and
      the deluge to make a human accounting of the booming business
      of global warming. By letting climate change continue
      unchecked, we are choosing to adapt to a warming world.
      Containing the resulting surge will be big business; some
      will benefit, but much of the planet will suffer. McKenzie
      Funk has investigated both sides, and what he has found will
      shock us all. </p>
      <p>
        To understand how the world is preparing to warm, 
        <em>Windfall</em>
         follows the money.
